libnetmd.py - A python implementation of NetMD protocol.

DISCLAIMER
  In short: If it break, you get to keep the pieces.

  This library implements a proprietary, non-documented protocol.
  Some methods are not tested [enough], so they might just not work, or cause
  data loss, or brick your NetMD. Use at your own risk.

REQUIREMENTS
  libusb1
  python2.4 or later
  A NetMD minidisc player.
  An USB cable.

  For dump_md.py:
    sox (and plugins to access your audio system)
    A sound card with analog input.
    An audio cable.

FILES
  Libraries:
    libnetmd.py  Python implementation of NetMD protocol.
    libusb1.py   Ctypes-based python wrapper around libusb1.
    usb1.py      Object definitions for libusb1.py functions.

  Utils:
    lsusb.py     Sample implementation of lsusb command using usb1.py.
    mdctl.py     Stupid pdb-based command line to test libnetmd.py methods.
    lsmd.py      Display disc title, tracks, ... of connected NetMD.
    dump_md.py   Play tracks on a connected NetMD and record them to files.

NOTES
  You need to be root to access a device on the USB bus (or at least, to have
  read/write permission on the /proc/bus/usb/*/* corresponding to your NetMD).

  dump_md.py contains some Works-For-Me values, it might require some tweaks
  for tracks to be properly recorded (depends on noise level, minidisk player
  reactivity...).
